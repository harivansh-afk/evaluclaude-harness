passingThreshold: 0.7

criteria:
  - name: readability
    weight: 0.3
    description: Code is easy to read and understand
    examples:
      good: "Clear variable names, logical flow, proper indentation"
      bad: "Single-letter variables, deeply nested logic, inconsistent style"
  
  - name: correctness
    weight: 0.4
    description: Code correctly implements the intended behavior
    examples:
      good: "Handles edge cases, correct algorithm, proper error handling"
      bad: "Missing edge cases, off-by-one errors, swallowed exceptions"
  
  - name: efficiency
    weight: 0.2
    description: Code uses appropriate data structures and algorithms
    examples:
      good: "O(n) where O(n) is optimal, avoids unnecessary allocations"
      bad: "O(n²) when O(n) is possible, creates objects in tight loops"
  
  - name: maintainability
    weight: 0.1
    description: Code is easy to modify and extend
    examples:
      good: "Single responsibility, low coupling, clear interfaces"
      bad: "God functions, tight coupling, magic numbers"
